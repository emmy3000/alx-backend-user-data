# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## 1. What Authentication Means

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or system to grant access to a resource or service. It ensures that only authorized entities can perform certain actions or access specific data.

## 2. What Base64 Is

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is commonly used for encoding binary data, such as images or files, into a format suitable for text-based protocols or storage.

## 3. How to Encode a String in Base64

Encoding a string in Base64 involves converting the characters in the string to their corresponding Base64 representation. Various programming languages and tools offer functions or libraries to perform this encoding. Typically, it results in a string composed of characters from the Base64 character set.

## 4. What Basic Authentication Means

Basic Authentication is a simple method of authentication used in HTTP-based communication. It involves sending a username and password in an HTTP request's Authorization header. The credentials are typically Base64-encoded and sent over the network.

## 5. How to Send the Authorization Header

Sending the Authorization header in an HTTP request involves including the credentials (username and password) as a Base64-encoded string in the header. The header is constructed as follows:
```shell
Authorization: Basic base64EncodedCredentials
```
Replace base64EncodedCredentials with the Base64-encoded string of your username and password separated by a colon (e.g., "username:password"). This header is commonly used for HTTP Basic Authentication.
